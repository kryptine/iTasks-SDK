For building the JavaScript files, you will need Sencha Cmd [1] in your path.
The easiest way is to use the makefile:

  make (defaults to `make testing`)

or specific environments

  make testing make production

Also make sure to get a recent copy of ExtJS 4.1.x and place it in the
Client/ext directory.
