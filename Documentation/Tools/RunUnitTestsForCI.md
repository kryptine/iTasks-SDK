# Unit Test Runnner Tool
The [code quality monitor tool](CodeQualityMonitor.md) is useful for interactively monitoring the health of the iTasks codebase. But it can't be used for automated testing in our build pipeline. The unit test runner tool can be used for this purpose. It is a command line tool that requires no input and simply compiles and executes all automated tests. It reports the results on stdout and sets a return code of 1 when one of the tests fails, or even fails to compile. This makes it possible to use it with CI tools such as [Jenkins](http://jenkins.io) that we use to build and test Clean and iTasks.
