Follow these steps to get a working system:

 1. Install clean. Download the Clean nightly distribution for your Mac, unzip
    it in your home directory (e.g. in ~/clean) and run make inside that
    directory.

 2. In your shell's initialization script, add the following line:

      export CLEAN_HOME=~/clean
      export PATH=$CLEAN_HOME/lib/exe:$CLEAN_HOME/bin:$PATH

    Change ~/clean to the appropriate path if you have installed Clean
    somewhere else.

 3. Append the contents of iTasks.env to $CLEAN_HOME/etc/IDEEnvs

 4. Compile the latest graph_copy for your platform. It can be found in
    $CLEAN_HOME/lib/iTasks-SDK/Dependencies/graph_copy. Remove
    graph_to_string_with_descriptors.icl and rename
    graph_to_string_with_descriptors_macho.icl to
    graph_to_string_with_descriptors.icl. Build graph_copy using:

      make -f Makefile.macosx

 5. You are now ready to compile your iTasks program. The best way to do so is
    by using CPM. To build all project files in the current directory, simply
    type

      cpm make

    To build a specific project file, type

      cpm project MyProject.prj build

    CPM has a built-in help system as well.
