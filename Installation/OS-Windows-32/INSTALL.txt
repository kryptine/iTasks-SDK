=== Setup ===

= First install the Clean 2.4 32-bit distribution on your machine (download it from the Clean site: http://wiki.clean.cs.ru.nl/Download_Clean). 
There are versions for the PC, Mac, and Linux.

= Preparation of the Clean IDE for iTasks =
- Make sure that this SDK is placed in the folder of the Clean 2.4 32-bit distribution (the one that contains "CleanIDE.exe")
  and is called "iTasks-SDK".
- You need to use the "iTasks-SDK/Installation/<OS version>/CleanIDE.exe", which must be in the same folder as the regular CleanIDE.exe. 
  If you want to use both, rename "iTasks-SDK/Binaries/<Windows version>/CleanIDE.exe" and move it in the same folder as CleanIDE.exe.
- Start the CleanIDE
- Import the "iTasks" environment by choosing "Environment" -> "Import..." from the menu
  and selecting the "iTasks-SDK/Installation/<OS version>/iTasks.env" environment file.
- Set your default heap size for projects to 128M by choosing "Project" -> "Project defaults..." from the menu
- Copy the folder "iTasks-SDK/Installation/Files/Sapl" into "Libraries/StdEnv/".
  The compilation process creates a directory called "sapl" which contains all the necessary SAPL files;
  this directory will be used by the client side execution infrastucture of the iTask toolkit.
- Copy the file "iTasks-SDK/Installation/Files/_system.abc" into "Libraries/StdEnv/Clean System Files/". This is adds the
  predefined type () which is used for tasks without a result.

= Building examples =
The most up-to-date example suite to run at the moment is the examples collection for the CEFP Summerschool.
- Open the "iTasks-SDK/Documentation/Examples/BasicAPIExamples.prj" Clean project. ("File" -> "Open...")
- You build the project by choosing ("Project" -> "Update and Run") from the menu.
- A BasicAPIExamples.exe server is started automatically which you can access at "http://localhost/"
- Further instructions for setting up are given by the server

= SDK Path =
The iTask system has to find the path to the SDK. There are three ways to make sure it can find it:

1. Make sure your executable is executed in a sub-directory of the Clean installation (not more than 5 levels deeper than the Clean root), e.g. by creating your project in such location.
2. Set the environment variable CLEAN_HOME to the root directory of your Clean installation.
3. Install Clean in "C:\Clean 2.4".
