This directory contains all Clean libraries necessary for building iTasks server applications.

The "iTasks" environment contains all the libraries.
IT WILL ONLY WORK if your iTasks checkout is called "iTasks" and in a directory called "Projects" in the base
directory of your Clean System, because all paths are referenced relatively and begin with "{APPLICATION}\Projects\iTasks\Server".
