This directory contains all Clean libraries necessary for building iTasks server applications.
The "iTasks" environment includes all the libraries. It assumes that you have your iTasks distribution in a "Projects"
directory of your Clean System. All paths are relative to the Clean System and begin with "{APPLICATION}\Projects\iTasks\Server".
