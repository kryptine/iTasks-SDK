Because automated testing is not yet implemented, this document is a first start to
collect the common system tests that we do as a basic checklist

Common tests to do manually:

- Check if BasicAPIExamples compiles and runs
- Check if a UI shows up in the browser
- Check if the UI responds to events
- Check if the server is not 100% cpu when idle
- Check if the clocks are updated properly. For example by viewing the date time shares
- Check if UIs with share data sources sync properly
- Check if editlets load and run properly
- Check if typing fast (fast occuring events) causes sync problems (easy to reintroduce bug)
